This is a simple sorting program.

## Features

### integer_sort
Integer sorting allows you to sort arrays of integers from smallest to largest.


We can use this by creating a class that takes an array
```
sort = Sort([6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1])
```

Then we have to call the `integer_sort` function
```
sorted_array = sort.interger_sort()
```
